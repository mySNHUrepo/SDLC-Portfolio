# SDLC-Portfolio

  Interpreting user needs usually starts with analysing the system and getting feedback from the team 
on what it is we need to achieve, and what we have to achieve it. In this process, set requirements and 
talk about techniques you think will be most helpful on the project.

  User stories help this process by giving you a card of information directly from the user with a name,
and index, a priority, and what it is they wish they would have seen. It's a fantastic tool for 
understanding the program or product from the user's perspective.

  Before this class, I used somewhat of a frankenstein mixture of waterfall and agile. I tried to plan out
everything from the beginning, but it would never pan out, which would frusterate me. Learning Agile was 
great for me, because it helped me realize I wasn't supposed to be trying to plan out these big softwares
from the beginning. One thing I am going to take from Agile is Scrum. I am on a game project called 
Ardenfall where we were almost scrumming by accident, with weekly scrums and whatnot. Since thene we have
added sprints, a sprint backlog and a game backlog. 

   To be a good team member on a software team, you should care about the project's design principles 
  and follow them earnestly. You should always try your hardest, and ask for help when
  you genuinely need it. You should stay up to date on the project and sprint, out of mutual respect
  for you team, and treat them with dignity and courtesy when they come to you with problems.
